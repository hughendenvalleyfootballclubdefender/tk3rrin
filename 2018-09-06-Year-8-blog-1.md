    <td>As this was the first lesson in year 9 we were told to make a new repository and delete our old ones. When making my new one I used websites that we have used before quite helpful. I also found that the websites that mr keen showed us were helpful as well.</td>

    <td>The problems I made partly limited it as I couldn't always understand where or what the error that I had made was, I also need to work on the actual coding as when I tried to import image addresses or tried to code I always forgot some sort of punctuation.</td>

    <td>I will try to code more slowly and have more understanding of what I do, I can do this by looking at the websites mr keen showed us.</td>
